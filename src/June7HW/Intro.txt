Q. Tell me about yourself?

Ans : Hello, my name is Prem, am currently working with X company as a Full stack developer. I have 8 years of professional experience in Enterprise software application development, testing, production support and maintenance. So, being a full-stack developer, I have used Java for backend functionalities along with frameworks like React JS, for developing dashboards and Web Applications. Throughout my career I have used various tools and technologies like JEE, Spring, Spring Boot, Hibernate for back-end development, HTML, CSS, Angular for front-end development, version control tools like GIT for source code management, and CI/CD tools like Jenkins for deployment purposes. I have also set up infrastructure for hosting the application in both lower and higher environments. I have also participated in troubleshooting the production defects.

Q. Tell me about your recent project?

Ans : I am working for Wells Fargo, which is a banking company. So, here I am working on their money movement platform which is responsible for moving funds to and from Wells Fargo bank accounts. We support various programs such as ACH, Overdraft, Bill Payment, and Instant Funding based on the cost, and the type of transfer the user opts for. We also internally integrate with payment rails like Mastercard, Visa, AMEX and Discover and facilitate these money movement operations.

I am also responsible for helping with migration from legacy monolithic to microservices based architecture. Most of these newer services are containerized in Docker and these Docker images are orchestrated through Kubernetes. In our current project we are using AWS cloud platform and I have worked on most of their service offerings. 

We follow Test driven development and Agile methodology for developing our project.

In general, I enjoy working in collaborative and challenging environments where there is a lot to learn and where there is an opportunity to deliver something meaningful.
